Be not elated at an excellence which is not your own. If the horse in his pride
were to say,  ``I am handsome,'' we could  bear with it. But when  you say with
pride, ``I have a  handsome horse,'' know that the good horse  is the ground of
your pride. You  ask then what you  can call your own. The  answer is---the way
you deal with  your impressions. Therefore when you deal  with your impressions
in accord with nature, then you may be  proud indeed, for your pride will be in
a good which is your own.
