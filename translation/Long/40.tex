Women  forthwith from  the age  of fourteen  are called  by the  men mistresses
(dominae). Therefore  since they see that  there is nothing else  that they can
obtain,  but  only  the  power  of  lying with  men,  they  begin  to  decorate
themselves, and to place all their hopes in this. It is worth our while then to
take care  that they may know  that they are  valued (by men) for  nothing else
than appearing (being) decent and modest and discreet.
