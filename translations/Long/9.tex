Disease is  an impediment to  the body,  but not to  the will, unless  the will
itself chooses. Lameness is an impediment to  the leg, but not to the will. And
add this  reflection on the occasion  of everything that happens;  for you will
find it an impediment to something else, but not to yourself.
