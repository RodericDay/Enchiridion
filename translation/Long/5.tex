Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but by the opinions about the
things: for example, death  is nothing terrible, for if it  were, it would have
seemed so to Socrates; for the opinion about death, that it is terrible, is the
terrible thing. When then we are impeded  or disturbed or grieved, let us never
blame  others, but  ourselves, that  is,  our opinions.  It  is the  act of  an
ill-instructed man to blame others for his  own bad condition; it is the act of
one who  has begun to be  instructed, to lay the  blame on himself; and  of one
whose instruction is completed, neither to blame another, nor himself.
