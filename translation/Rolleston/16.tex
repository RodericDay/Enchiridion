When you shall  see one lamenting in  grief because his son is  gone abroad, or
because he  has lost his  wealth, see to  it that you  be not rapt-away  by the
phantasm, to think that he has  suffered a real misfortune in external matters.
But be the thought at hand, \emph{It is not the fact itself which afflicts this
man---since there  are others  whom it  afflicts not---but  the opinion  he has
conceived about it.} And  do not hesitate as far as words go,  to give him your
sympathy, and even,  if so it be, to  lament with him. But take  heed that your
lamenting be not from within.
