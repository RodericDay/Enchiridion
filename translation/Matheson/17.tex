Remember that you are an actor in a play, and the Playwright chooses the manner
of it: if he wants it short, it is  short; if long, it is long. If he wants you
to act a  poor man you must act the  part with all your powers; and  so if your
part be a cripple  or a magistrate or a plain man. For  your business is to act
the character  that is given  you and act  it well; the  choice of the  cast is
Another's.
