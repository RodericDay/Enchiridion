If you  set your desire  on philosophy  you must at  once prepare to  meet with
ridicule  and the  jeers  of many  who  will  say, 'Here  he  is again,  turned
philosopher. Where has he  got these proud looks?' Nay, put  on no proud looks,
but hold fast to what seems best to  you, in confidence that God has set you at
this post. And remember that if you  abide where you are, those who first laugh
at you will one day admire you, and that  if you give way to them, you will get
doubly laughed at.
