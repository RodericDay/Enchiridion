Everything has  two handles, the  one by  which it may  be borne, the  other by
which it may not. If your brother acts  unjustly, do not lay hold of the act by
that handle wherein  he acts unjustly, for  this is the handle  which cannot be
borne; but lay hold of the other, that he is your brother, that he was nurtured
with you, and you will lay hold of the  thing by that handle by which it can be
borne.
