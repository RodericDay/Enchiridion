When a raven croaks with evil omen,  let not the impression carry you away, but
straightway distinguish in your own mind  and say, 'These portents mean nothing
to me;  but only  to my bit  of a  body or my  bit of property  or name,  or my
children  or my  wife. But  for me  all omens  are favourable  if I  will, for,
whatever the issue may be, it is in my power to pt benefit therefrom.'
