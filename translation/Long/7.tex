As on a voyage when the vessel has reached  a port, if you go out to get water,
it is an  amusement by the way to  pick up a shell-fish or some  bulb, but your
thoughts ought  to be  directed to  the ship,  and you  ought to  be constantly
watching if  the captain should  call, and then you  must throw away  all those
things, that you may  not be bound and pitched into the ship  like sheep: so in
life also, if there be given to you instead of a little bulb and a shell a wife
and child, there will be nothing to  prevent (you from taking them). But if the
captain should call, run to the ship, and leave all those things without regard
to them. But  if you are old, do not  even go far from the ship,  lest when you
are called you make default.
