Never say of anything, ``\emph{I have lost it,}'' but, ``\emph{I have restored it.}'' Has
your child died? It is restored. Has your wife died? She is restored. Has
your estate been taken away? That likewise is restored. ``\emph{But it was a bad
man who took it.}'' What is it to you by whose hands he who gave it has
demanded it again? While he permits you to possess it, hold it as
something not your own, as do travelers at an inn.
