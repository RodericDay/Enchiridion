Everything has two handles,  one by which you can carry it,  the other by which
you cannot.  If your brother  wrongs you,  do not take  it by that  handle, the
handle of his wrong,  for you cannot carry it by that, but  rather by the other
handle---that he is a  brother, brought up with you, and then  you will take it
by the handle that you can carry by.
