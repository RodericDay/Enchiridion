Never  in any  case say  \emph{I  have lost  such  a thing,}  but \emph{I  have
returned it.} Is  your child dead? It is  a return. Is your wife dead?  It is a
return. Are you deprived  of your estate? Is not this  also a return? \emph{But
he who deprives me of it is wicked!}  But what is that to you, through whom the
giver demands  his own! As long  therefore as he  grants it to you,  steward it
like another's property, as travelers use an inn.
