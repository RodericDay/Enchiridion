Does   a  man   bathe  himself   quickly?  Then   say  not   \emph{Badly},  but
\emph{Quickly}. Does  be drink  much wine?  Then say  not \emph{Too  much}, but
\emph{Much}. For  before you have discerned  how things appear to  him, how can
you know  if it were done  badly? Thus it will  not happen to you  to surrender
yourself  to  certain of  the  phantasms  which lay  hold  of  the mind,  while
comprehending others.
