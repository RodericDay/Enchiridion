There is  no nexus  in the  following reasonings: \emph{I  am richer  than you,
therefore I  am superior to you;  I am more  eloquent than you, therefore  I am
superior.}  But the  nexus is  rather  in these:  \emph{I am  richer than  you,
therefore  my  wealth is  superior  to  yours; I  am  more  eloquent than  you,
therefore my language  is superior to yours.}  But you are not  wealth, and you
are not language.
