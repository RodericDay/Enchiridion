If you wish to make progress, you must be content in external matters to seem a
fool and a  simpleton; do not wish men  to think you know anything,  and if any
should think  you to be  somebody, distrust yourself. For  know that it  is not
easy to keep your will in accord with  nature and at the same time keep outward
things; if you attend to one you must needs neglect the other.
