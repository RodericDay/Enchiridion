In every thing (circumstance) we should hold these maxims ready to hand:

\begin{quote}
  Lead me, O Zeus, and thou O Destiny,\\
  The way that I am bid by you to go:\\
  To follow I am ready. If I choose not,\\
  I make myself a wretch, and still must follow.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  But whoso nobly yields unto necessity,\\
  We hold him wise, and skill'd in things divine.
\end{quote}

And the third also: 

\begin{quote}
  O Crito, if so it pleases the Gods, so let it be; Anytus and \\
  Meletus are able indeed to kill me, but they cannot harm me.
\end{quote}
