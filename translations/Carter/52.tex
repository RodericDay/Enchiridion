Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand:

\begin{quote}
  Conduct me, Jove, and you, O Destiny, \\
  Wherever your decrees have fixed my station.\footnotemark
\end{quote}
\footnotetext{Cleanthes}

\begin{quote}
  I follow cheerfully; and, did I not, \\
  Wicked and wretched, I must follow still \\
  Whoever yields properly to Fate, is deemed \\
  Wise among men, and knows the laws of heaven.\footnotemark
\end{quote}
\footnotetext{Euripides, \emph{Frag.} 965}

And this third: 

\begin{quote}
  O Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be. Anytus and \\
  Melitus may kill me indeed, but hurt me they cannot.\footnotemark
\end{quote}
\footnotetext{Plato's \emph{Crito and Apology}}
