Does a man bathe quickly (early)? Do not  say that he bathes badly, but that he
bathes quickly. Does a man drink much wine? Do not say that he does this badly,
but say that he drinks much. For  before you shall have determined the opinion,
how do you know  whether he is acting wrong? Thus it will  not happen to you to
comprehend some  appearances which  are capable of  being comprehended,  but to
assent to others.
