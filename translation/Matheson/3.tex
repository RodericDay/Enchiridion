When anything, from the meanest thing  upwards, is attractive or serviceable or
an  object of  affection, remember  always to  say to  yourself, ``What  is its
nature?'' If you  are fond of a jug, say  you are fond of a jug;  then you will
not be disturbed if  it be broken. If you kiss your child  or your wife, say to
yourself that you are  kissing a human being, for then if  death strikes it you
will not be disturbed.
