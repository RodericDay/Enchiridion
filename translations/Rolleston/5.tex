It is not things in themselves, but  the opinions held about them which trouble
and confuse our  minds. Thus, Death is  not really terrible---if it  were so it
would have  appeared so to Socrates---but  the opinion about Death,  that it is
terrible, that it  is wherein the terror lies. Wherefore  when we are hindered,
or confounded, or  grieved, let us never  cast the blame upon  others, but upon
ourselves; that  is, on our  opinions of things.  A man untaught  in philosophy
accuses others on the  score of his misfortunes; he who has  begun to be taught
accuses himself; he who is fully taught, neither others nor himself.
