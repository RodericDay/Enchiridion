When you have  adopted the simple life,  do not pride yourself upon  it, and if
you are a water-drinker  do not say on every occasion,  'I am a water-drinker.'
And if you ever want to train laboriously,  keep it to yourself and do not make
a show  of it.  Do not embrace  statues. If  you are very  thirsty take  a good
draught of cold water, and rinse you mouth and tell no one.
