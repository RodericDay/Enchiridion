When you are  doing something which you have clearly  recognized as being right
to do, do not seek to avoid observation in the act, even though you should know
that the multitude  will form a wrong  opinion about it, For if  you are acting
wrongly, then  you should have avoided  the action altogether. But  if rightly,
why fear those who wrongly rebuke you?
