These reasons do not  cohere: I am richer than you, therefore  I am better than
you;  I am  more eloquent  than you,  therefore I  am better  than you.  On the
contrary these  rather cohere, I am  richer than you, therefore  my possessions
are greater  than yours: I  am more eloquent than  you, therefore my  speech is
superior to yours. But you are neither possession nor speech.
