You can be invincible, if you never enter  on a contest where victory is not in
your power. Beware then that when you see a man raised to honour or great power
or  high repute  you do  not let  your impression  carry you  away. For  if the
reality of  good lies in  what is in  our power, there is  no room for  envy or
jealousy. And you will not wish to be  praetor, or prefect or consul, but to be
free; and  there is  but one  way to freedom---to  despise what  is not  in our
power.
