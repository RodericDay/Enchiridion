Remember,  that not  he who  gives  ill language  or  a blow  insults, but  the
principle which represents  these things as insulting.  When, therefore, anyone
provokes you, be assured  that it is your own opinion  which provokes you. Try,
therefore, in the first place, not to  be hurried away with the appearance. For
if you once gain time and respite, you will more easily command yourself.
