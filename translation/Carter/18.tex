When a raven happens to croak unluckily, don't allow the appearance
hurry you away with it, but immediately make the distinction to yourself,
and say, ``None of these things are foretold to me; but either to my
paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But
to me all omens are lucky, if I will. For whichever of these things
happens, it is in my control to derive advantage from it.''
