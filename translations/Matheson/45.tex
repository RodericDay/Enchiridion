If a  man wash quickly,  do not say  that he washes  badly, but that  he washes
quickly. If a man drink much wine, do not say that he drinks badly, but that he
drinks much. For till  you have decided what judgement prompts  him, how do you
know  that he  acts  badly?  If you  do  as  I say,  you  will  assent to  your
apprehensive impressions and to none other.
