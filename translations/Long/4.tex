When you are going to take in hand any act, remind yourself what kind of an act
it is.  If you are going  to bathe, place  before yourself what happens  in the
bath:  some splashing  the water,  others pushing  against one  another, others
abusing one  another, and  some stealing;  and thus with  more safety  you will
undertake the  matter, if you say  to yourself, I  now intend to bathe,  and to
maintain my will in a manner conformable to nature. And so you will do in every
act: for  thus if any  hindrance to bathing shall  happen, let this  thought be
ready; it was not this only that I intended, but I intended also to maintain my
will in a  way conformable to nature; but  I shall not maintain it so,  if I am
vexed at what happens.
