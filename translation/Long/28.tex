If any person was  intending to put your body in the power  of any man whom you
fell  in  with  on  the  way,  you  would be  vexed:  but  that  you  put  your
understanding in  the power  of any  man whom you  meet, so  that if  he should
revile you, it is disturbed and troubled, are you not ashamed at this?
