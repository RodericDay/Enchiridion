When a raven happens to croak unluckily, be not overcome by appearances,
but discriminate and say, ``\emph{Nothing is portended to \emph{me}, either to my
paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But to
\emph{me} all portents are lucky if I will. For whatsoever happens, it belongs
to me to derive advantage therefrom.}''
