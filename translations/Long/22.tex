If you desire philosophy, prepare yourself  from the beginning to be ridiculed,
to expect that many will sneer at you,  and say, He has all at once returned to
us as a philosopher;  and whence does he get this supercilious  look for us? Do
you not show a  supercilious look; but hold on to the things  which seem to you
best as one appointed by God to this station. And remember that if you abide in
the same principles,  these men who first ridiculed will  afterward admire you:
but if  you shall  have been overpowered  by them, you  will bring  on yourself
double ridicule.
