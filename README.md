# The Enchiridion of Epictetus

A handbook of basic practices of stoicism typeset in LaTeX.
This current version was translated by Elizabeth Carter.
This projects exists because I wanted a digital copy of the Enchiridion
to read on my tablet.



# Latest Changes

### 14 Aug 2015
 - Changed page dimensions to 6 by 9 inches for tablet.
 - Added Elizabeth Carter's translation and made it the default.
 - Added GNU GPLv2 License.



# ToDo
 
 - Create a book cover and/or title page.
 - Make a few changes to Carter's translation. There are too many commas 
   and a few other wonky things.
 - Add more translations and make compiling different translations
   a feature of the Makefile.
