Remember that it is  not he who strikes you or he who  reviles you who does you
an injury, but the opinion you have  about the things, that they are injurious.
Therefore when someone  shall provoke you to wrath, know  that you are provoked
by your own  conception. Strive then at  the outset not to be  rapt-away by the
phantasm; for if you shall once succeed in gaining time and delay you will more
easily master yourself.
