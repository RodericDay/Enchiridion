On every occasion we must have these thoughts at hand,

\begin{quote}
  'Lead me, O Zeus, and lead me, Destiny, \\
  Whither ordained is by your decree. \\
  I'll follow, doubting not, or if with will \\
  Recreant I falter, I shall follow still.' [Cleanthes] 
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  'Who rightly with necessity complies In things divine we \\
  count him skilled and wise.' [Euripides, Fragment 965]
\end{quote}
