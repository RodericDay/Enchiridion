If it should  ever happen to you to  be turned to externals in  order to please
some  person, you  must  know that  you  have  lost your  purpose  in life.  Be
satisfied then in everything with being a  philosopher; and if you wish to seem
also to any person to be a philosopher,  appear so to yourself, and you will be
able to do this.
