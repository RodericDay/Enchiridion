As the proposition, ``Either it is day or it is night,'' is extremely
proper for a disjunctive argument, but quite improper in a conjunctive
one, so, at a feast, to choose the largest share is very suitable
to the bodily appetite, but utterly inconsistent with the social spirit
of an entertainment. When you eat with another, then, remember not
only the value of those things which are set before you to the body,
but the value of that behavior which ought to be observed towards
the person who gives the entertainment.
