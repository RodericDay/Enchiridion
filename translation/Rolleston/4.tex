When you are about to take in hand some action, bethink yourself what it really
is that  you are about to  do. If you propose  to go to the  bath, represent to
yourself  all the  things that  take place  at the  bathing establishment,  the
squirting of  water, the beating, the  bad language, the theft.  And after this
fashion you will take the matter more  safely in hand if you say \emph{I intend
simply to bathe, and to maintain my purpose according to Nature.} And similarly
with every  action. For  thus if  anything should  occur to  cross you  in your
bathing, you  will instantly think  \emph{I did not  only intend to  bathe, but
also that my purpose should be maintained  according to Nature. But it will not
be so maintained if I let myself be vexed at what occurs.}
