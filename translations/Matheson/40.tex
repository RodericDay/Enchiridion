Women from fourteen years upwards are  called ``madam'' by men. Wherefore, when
they see  that the  only advantage they  have got is  to be  marriageable, they
begin to make themselves smart and to set all their hopes on this. We must take
pains then  to make them understand  that they are really  honoured for nothing
but a modest and decorous life.
