Don't be prideful with any excellence that is not your own. If
a horse should be prideful and say, ``I am handsome,'' it would be
supportable. But when you are prideful, and say, ``I have a handsome
horse,'' know that you are proud of what is, in fact, only the good
of the horse. What, then, is your own? Only your reaction to the appearances
of things. Thus, when you behave conformably to nature in reaction
to how things appear, you will be proud with reason; for you will
take pride in some good of your own.
