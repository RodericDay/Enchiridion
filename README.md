# The Enchiridion of Epictetus

---

A handbook of basic practices of stoicism typeset in LaTeX.
This current version was translated by Thomas Wentworth Higginson.
This projects exists because I wanted a digital copy of the enchiridion
to read on my tablet.

# ToDo
 
 - Add a license.
 - Better cover/title/maketitle
 - Different translations / ways to easily switch in the Makefile
 - Change pagesize for tablet (to a book size?)
