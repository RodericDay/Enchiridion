The measure of possession  (property) is to every man the body,  as the foot is
of the shoe. If then you stand on this rule (the demands of the body), you will
maintain the measure: but if you pass  beyond it, you must then of necessity be
hurried as it were down a precipice. As  also in the matter of the shoe, if you
go beyond the (necessities  of the) foot, the shoe is gilded,  then of a purple
color, the embroidered: for there is no limit to that which has once passed the
true measure.
