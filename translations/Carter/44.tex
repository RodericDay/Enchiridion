These  reasonings are  unconnected:  ``I am  richer than  you,  therefore I  am
better'';  ``I  am  more  eloquent  than you,  therefore  I  am  better.''  The
connection is  rather this: ``I  am richer than  you, therefore my  property is
greater than  yours;'' ``I  am more  eloquent than you,  therefore my  style is
better than yours.'' But you, after all, are neither property nor style.
