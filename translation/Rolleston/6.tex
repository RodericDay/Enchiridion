Be not puffed-up on account of any that  is not of yourself. If your horse were
proud and should say, \emph{I am  beautiful,} that would be tolerable. But when
you are  proud, and say,  \emph{I have  a beautiful horse,}  how that it  is an
excellence in your horse  that you are proud of. What then  is really your own?
This, to make use  of the phantasms. So that when you  deal according to Nature
in your use of the phantasms, then you may pride yourself, for then you will be
priding yourself on an excellence which is really your own.
