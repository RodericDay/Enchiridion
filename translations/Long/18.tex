When a raven has croaked inauspiciously,  let not the appearance hurry you away
with it; but straightway make a distinction in your mind and say, None of these
things is signified to me, but either to my poor body, or to my small property,
or  to  my reputation,  or  to  my  children or  to  my  wife:  but to  me  all
significations  are  auspicious if  I  choose.  For  whatever of  these  things
results, it is in my power to derive benefit from it.
