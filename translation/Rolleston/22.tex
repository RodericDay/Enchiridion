If you set your heart upon philosophy, you must straightway prepare yourself to
be laughed at and mocked by many who will say \emph{Behold a philosopher arisen
among us!} or \emph{How came you by that  brow of scorn?} But do you cherish no
scorn, but hold to  those things which seem to you the best,  as one set by God
in that place. Remember  too, that if you abide in those  ways, those who first
mocked you, the same shall afterwards reverence  you; but if you yield to them,
you will be laughed at twice as much as before.
