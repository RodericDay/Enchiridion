Does anyone bathe in a mighty little time? Don't say that he does
it ill, but in a mighty little time. Does anyone drink a great quantity
of wine? Don't say that he does ill, but that he drinks a great quantity.
For, unless you perfectly understand the principle from which anyone
acts, how should you know if he acts ill? Thus you will not run the
hazard of assenting to any appearances but such as you fully comprehend.
