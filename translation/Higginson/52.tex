Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand:

\begin{quote}
  Conduct me, Zeus, and thou, O Destiny, \\
  Wherever your decrees have fixed my lot. \\
  I follow cheerfully; and, did I not, \\
  Wicked and wretched, I must follow still.\footnotemark
\end{quote}
\footnotetext{Cleanthes, in Diogenes Laertius, 
quoted also by Seneca, \emph{Epistle} 107.}

\begin{quote}
  Who'er yields properly to Fate is deemed \\
  Wise among men, and knows the laws of Heaven.\footnotemark
\end{quote}
\footnotetext{Euripides, Fragments.}

And this third:

\begin{quote}
  ``O Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be.''\footnotemark
\end{quote}
\footnotetext{Plato, \emph{Crito}, Chap. XVII.}

\begin{quote}
  ``Anytus and Melitus may kill me indeed; but hurt me they cannot.''\footnotemark
\end{quote}
\footnotetext{Plato, \emph{Apology}, Chap. XVIII.}
