If it ever happen  to you to be diverted to things outside,  so that you desire
to please another,  know that you have  lost your life's plan.  Be content then
always  to be  a philosopher;  if you  wish  to be  regarded as  one too,  show
yourself that you are one and you will be able to achieve it.
