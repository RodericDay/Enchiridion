It is illogical to reason thus, ``I am richer than you, therefore I am superior
to you,'' ``I am  more eloquent than you, therefore I am  superior to you.'' It
is more  logical to reason,  ``I am richer than  you, therefore my  property is
superior to  yours,'' ``I  am more  eloquent than you,  therefore my  speech is
superior to yours.'' You are something more than property or speech.
