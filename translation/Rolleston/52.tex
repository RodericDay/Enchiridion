Hold in readiness for every heed, these---

\begin{quote}
  ``Lead me, O Zeus, and thou Destiny,\\
  whithersoever ye have appointed me to go,\\
  and may I follow fearlessly.
  
  ``But if in an evil mind I be unwilling,\\
  still must I follow.''
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  ``That man is wise among us, 
  and has understanding of things divine, 
  who has nobly agreed with Necessity.''
\end{quote}

But the third also---

\begin{quote}
  ``O Crito, if so it seem good to the Gods, so let it be; 
  Anytus and Melitus are able to kill me if they like, 
  but to harm me, never.''
\end{quote}
