As a mark\footnotemark is not set up for the sake of missing the aim, so neither
does the nature of evil exist in the world.
\footnotetext{Happiness, the effect of virtue, is the mark which God has set up for
us to aim at. Our missing it is no work of His; nor so properly
anything real, as a mere negative and failure of our own.}
